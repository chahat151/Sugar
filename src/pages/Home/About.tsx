          At Sugar, we only use natural ingredients, steering clear of synthetic
          powders and artificial additives. We're a bit picky when it comes to
          our ingredients. We only use the best nature has to offer – taste and
          quality mean everything to us. Always. We spend a lot of time
          searching for new and exciting flavors, and we're willing to go to
          great lengths for new innovative opportunities, but we never
          compromise on good taste. This is our love for natural chocolate.
